# Title: Replicate the Black Box: Recreate an Application without Understanding It

## Keywords
Replicate applications, systematic code generation, data exploration

## TL;DR
Can we replicate an application without understanding it? It's possible to build an application just from screenshots, but is it feasible for an application with more than ten UI interfaces?

## Abstract
The goal of replicating an application as a black box is to understand its domain knowledge by exploring features, workflows, and UI screenshots, then implementing them in a novel way. We propose using the new application to generate feature descriptions, workflows, and UI screenshots, which we then distill into domain knowledge to ensure accurate replication.
