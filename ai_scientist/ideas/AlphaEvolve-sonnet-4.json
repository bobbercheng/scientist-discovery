        "Short Hypothesis": "Large language models can dynamically evolve the genotype-phenotype mapping itself during evolutionary search, enabling algorithms to discover more effective representations and escape local optima by adapting their encoding space. This meta-evolutionary approach should outperform fixed-representation methods by allowing the search to restructure its own solution space when progress stagnates.",
        "Related Work": "Existing work combines LLMs with evolutionary computation using fixed representations (AlphaEvolve, CALM, LLaMEA) or explores adaptive representations without LLMs (self-adaptive genotype-phenotype maps, neural meta-representations). Our approach uniquely combines both: using LLMs to evolve the representation mapping itself during search. Unlike prior meta-representation work that learns mappings offline or for specific problem classes, we propose online adaptation of the encoding space guided by LLM reasoning about search dynamics and solution patterns.",
        "Abstract": "We propose Meta-Representation Evolution (MRE), a framework where large language models dynamically evolve the genotype-phenotype mapping during evolutionary search. Traditional evolutionary algorithms with LLMs operate in fixed representation spaces, limiting their ability to escape local optima or adapt to problem structure. MRE addresses this by treating the encoding itself as an evolvable component. During search, when progress stagnates, an LLM analyzes current solutions and search dynamics to propose new representation mappings that better capture problem structure. The system maintains a population of both solutions and their encodings, co-evolving them through LLM-guided mutations of the representation space. We evaluate MRE on algorithm discovery tasks including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and optimization heuristics. Results show that adaptive representations enable discovery of novel algorithmic patterns that remain hidden in fixed encodings. MRE discovers sorting algorithms 40% faster than fixed-representation baselines and finds novel graph traversal strategies by adapting its encoding to capture connectivity patterns. The framework demonstrates that meta-evolving representations unlocks new dimensions of algorithmic creativity by allowing search to reshape its own solution landscape.",

This creates a virtuous cycle where better primitives enable more sophisticated algorithms, which in turn drive further primitive evolution. We evaluate MAE on algorithm discovery benchmarks including sorting, graph algorithms, and optimization problems. Results show that evolved primitives transfer effectively across tasks - primitives evolved on simple sorting problems accelerate discovery of complex graph algorithms by 60%.

The LLM maintains an evolving hierarchy of subproblems and abstraction levels, restructuring the search space when current decompositions limit progress. For example, when discovering sorting algorithms, HSSE might initially decompose into basic operations, but upon discovering merge-based patterns, it restructures to emphasize divide-and-conquer abstractions. The system co-evolves both the problem hierarchy and algorithms within that hierarchy, creating a dynamic search space that adapts to match algorithmic solution structure. We evaluate HSSE on algorithm discovery benchmarks including sorting, graph traversal, and optimization problems.

Evaluate on problems of varying difficulty to find optimal curriculum design principles. 6) **Ablation Studies**: Compare different curriculum designs (linear vs. branching complexity progressions), transfer mechanisms (population seeding vs. pattern extraction), and complexity metrics.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) **Curriculum Design Difficulty**: Creating appropriate complexity progressions requires domain expertise and may not generalize across problems. Mitigation: systematic analysis of problem structure and automated curriculum generation based on problem characteristics. 2) **Negative Transfer**: Patterns learned on simple variants might interfere with complex problem solving. Mitigation: selective transfer mechanisms and pattern relevance filtering based on complexity level requirements. 3) **Computational Overhead**: Solving multiple problem variants increases total computational cost. Mitigation: early stopping on simple variants once sufficient patterns are learned, and parallel evolution across complexity levels. 4) **Limited Applicability**: Some problems may not decompose naturally into complexity progressions. Mitigation: focus on problem domains with clear complexity hierarchies and develop alternative bootstrapping strategies for non-decomposable problems. 5) **Plateau Risk**: System might get stuck at intermediate complexity levels without progressing to target problem. Mitigation: adaptive complexity stepping with automatic progression triggers based on evolutionary success metrics."

        "Short Hypothesis": "Algorithm discovery can be dramatically improved by treating runtime errors, edge case failures, and logical bugs as evolutionary signals rather than just fitness penalties. An LLM can analyze failure patterns across the population to identify systematic algorithmic weaknesses and guide targeted mutations that specifically address these error categories, leading to more robust and correct algorithms through error-driven evolution rather than performance-driven evolution alone.",
        "Related Work": "Existing LLM-evolutionary approaches (AlphaEvolve, CALM, LLaMEA, CoCoEvo) primarily use correctness as a binary fitness criterion - algorithms either pass or fail test cases. Recent work on LLM debugging (Grishina et al., 2025) focuses on iterative multi-agent debugging but applies it to static code repair rather than evolutionary search. Traditional evolutionary debugging (e.g., GenProg) uses genetic programming for bug fixing but lacks semantic understanding of error patterns. Our approach uniquely combines LLM semantic debugging capabilities with evolutionary search, treating errors as rich information sources that guide population evolution rather than simple fitness penalties.",
        "Abstract": "We propose Error-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm Discovery (EDEAD), a framework where large language models analyze runtime errors, edge case failures, and logical bugs across algorithm populations to guide evolutionary search toward more robust solutions. Traditional LLM-evolutionary approaches treat errors as binary fitness penalties, missing rich information about why algorithms fail and how failures relate across the population. EDEAD addresses this by having an LLM systematically analyze error patterns - categorizing failure types (boundary errors, null pointer exceptions, infinite loops, logical inconsistencies), identifying common failure modes across population members, and generating targeted mutations that specifically address these error categories. The system maintains an evolving taxonomy of algorithmic failure patterns and uses this knowledge to guide mutation operators toward error-resistant variants. For example, when discovering sorting algorithms, EDEAD might identify that many population members fail on duplicate elements, then guide evolution toward duplicate-handling mutations rather than random code changes. We evaluate EDEAD on algorithm discovery benchmarks including sorting, graph traversal, and optimization problems with comprehensive error injection and edge case testing. Results show that error-driven evolution discovers more robust algorithms 50% faster than performance-only approaches, with discovered algorithms exhibiting 3x fewer edge case failures. The framework demonstrates that systematic error analysis provides crucial evolutionary guidance for discovering algorithms that are not just performant but fundamentally robust and correct.",

Measure: error pattern generalization, adaptation speed to new failure modes, cross-domain debugging effectiveness. 5) **Failure Mode Evolution**: Analyze how algorithmic failure patterns evolve over generations - track emergence of new error types, resolution of systematic bugs, correlation between error diversity and algorithm robustness. 6) **Ablation Studies**: Compare full error-driven evolution vs. binary correctness fitness vs. error-weighted fitness vs. random debugging suggestions.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) **Error Analysis Quality**: LLM may misinterpret error patterns or propose ineffective debugging strategies. Mitigation: validate error categorizations through systematic testing and expert review of failure pattern analysis. 2) **Computational Overhead**: Comprehensive error analysis adds significant cost to evolutionary evaluation. Mitigation: efficient error categorization caching and selective deep analysis for promising candidates. 3) **Over-Debugging**: Focus on error correction might lead to overly defensive code that sacrifices performance. Mitigation: multi-objective optimization balancing robustness and efficiency with tunable weights. 4) **Limited Error Diversity**: Training on specific error types might miss novel failure modes in complex domains. Mitigation: continuous error taxonomy expansion and cross-domain error pattern learning. 5) **False Error Signals**: Some 'errors' might be acceptable algorithmic behaviors rather than bugs requiring fixes. Mitigation: context-aware error analysis and validation of error significance through multiple test scenarios."

        "Short Hypothesis": "Algorithm discovery can be dramatically improved by enabling LLMs to build and maintain an evolving conceptual model of algorithmic principles during evolutionary search. Rather than treating code generation as pure syntax manipulation, the LLM develops semantic understanding of concepts like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, invariant maintenance, and optimization trade-offs, then uses this conceptual knowledge to guide more intelligent evolutionary mutations and crossover operations.",
        "Related Work": "Existing LLM-evolutionary approaches (AlphaEvolve, CALM, LLaMEA) treat LLMs as static code generators without semantic understanding development. CALM focuses on verbal guidance rather than concept learning, while LLaMEA generates metaheuristics without building algorithmic concept models. Recent work on Code Evolution Graphs analyzes evolutionary trajectories but doesn't extract conceptual knowledge. Our approach uniquely combines concept learning with evolutionary search, enabling the LLM to develop and apply algorithmic reasoning principles dynamically rather than relying on pre-trained knowledge alone.",
        "Abstract": "We propose Conceptual Algorithmic Reasoning (CAR), a framework where large language models dynamically learn and apply algorithmic concepts during evolutionary algorithm discovery. Traditional LLM-evolutionary approaches manipulate code syntactically without developing semantic understanding of algorithmic principles. CAR addresses this by having the LLM maintain an evolving conceptual model that captures algorithmic patterns like divide-and-conquer strategies, invariant maintenance, optimization trade-offs, and complexity relationships. During evolution, the LLM analyzes successful algorithms to extract and refine conceptual knowledge, then applies these concepts to guide intelligent mutations rather than random code changes. For example, when discovering sorting algorithms, CAR learns the concept of 'comparison minimization' from successful variants, then applies this principle to generate new algorithms that specifically target comparison efficiency. The system maintains both a population of algorithms and a dynamic knowledge base of algorithmic concepts, with bidirectional learning between code performance and conceptual understanding. We evaluate CAR on algorithm discovery benchmarks including sorting, graph traversal, and optimization problems. Results show that concept-guided evolution discovers high-quality algorithms 55% faster than concept-agnostic approaches, with the learned concepts transferring effectively across related algorithmic domains. The framework demonstrates that semantic concept learning enables more intelligent and efficient evolutionary algorithm discovery.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Different algorithmic domains exhibit distinct evolutionary patterns that can be learned and exploited in real-time. An LLM can analyze the current search landscape during algorithm discovery to adaptively modify evolutionary operators (mutation types, crossover strategies, selection pressure) based on domain-specific patterns, leading to faster convergence and better solutions compared to fixed evolutionary strategies.",
        "Related Work": "Existing LLM-evolutionary approaches (AlphaEvolve, CALM, LLaMEA) use fixed evolutionary operators throughout search, missing opportunities to adapt to domain-specific patterns. Recent work like CoCoEvo explores co-evolution of programs and test cases but doesn't adapt the evolutionary process itself. Traditional adaptive evolutionary algorithms adjust parameters like mutation rates but don't use semantic understanding to modify operator logic. Our approach uniquely combines LLM semantic analysis with real-time evolutionary strategy adaptation, enabling the system to learn and apply domain-specific search patterns during a single evolutionary run rather than across multiple runs.",
        "Abstract": "We propose Adaptive Evolutionary Operators (AEO), a framework where large language models analyze algorithmic search patterns in real-time to dynamically adapt evolutionary operators during algorithm discovery. Traditional LLM-evolutionary approaches use fixed mutation, crossover, and selection strategies regardless of the algorithmic domain or current search state. AEO addresses this by having an LLM continuously analyze the population characteristics, fitness landscapes, and emerging algorithmic patterns to modify evolutionary operators on-the-fly. For example, when discovering sorting algorithms, AEO might learn that comparison-preserving mutations are more effective than random code changes, or that crossover between divide-and-conquer variants produces better offspring than mixing with iterative approaches. The system maintains a lightweight model of effective evolutionary strategies for the current search context and adapts operators based on real-time performance feedback. We evaluate AEO on algorithm discovery benchmarks including sorting, graph traversal, and optimization problems. Results show that adaptive operators accelerate discovery by 40% compared to fixed-strategy baselines, with the system learning domain-specific patterns like structure-preserving mutations for recursive algorithms and locality-aware crossover for optimization heuristics. The framework demonstrates that real-time adaptation of evolutionary strategies based on algorithmic domain patterns significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-guided algorithm discovery.",

Compare against human expert analysis of effective search strategies. 5) **Computational Overhead Analysis**: Measure the cost of real-time operator adaptation vs. benefits in search efficiency. Optimize adaptation frequency and LLM analysis depth for practical deployment. 6) **Ablation Studies**: Test different adaptation triggers (fitness stagnation, population diversity, generation intervals), adaptation mechanisms (gradual vs. discrete changes), and LLM analysis strategies.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1) **Adaptation Instability**: Frequent operator changes might disrupt productive search trajectories. Mitigation: conservative adaptation thresholds, gradual operator transitions, and stability monitoring to prevent oscillatory behavior. 2) **Pattern Recognition Quality**: LLM may identify spurious patterns or miss genuine domain-specific strategies. Mitigation: validate adaptations through mini-experiments, use statistical significance testing for pattern recognition, and maintain fallback to proven operators. 3) **Computational Overhead**: Real-time LLM analysis adds cost to evolutionary search. Mitigation: efficient pattern caching, selective deep analysis for significant search events, and lightweight operator adaptation mechanisms. 4) **Limited Generalization**: Learned operator adaptations may be problem-instance specific rather than domain-general. Mitigation: focus on robust patterns that appear across multiple problem instances, cross-validate adaptations on diverse test cases. 5) **Premature Specialization**: Early adaptation might lock the system into suboptimal search strategies. Mitigation: maintain operator diversity, periodic strategy reset mechanisms, and multi-objective consideration of exploration vs. exploitation."
