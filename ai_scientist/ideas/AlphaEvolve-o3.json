        "Title": "Adaptive Modality Bridging: Dynamic Alignment for Robust Multimodal Representations",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Current multimodal contrastive learning approaches force exact alignment between modalities, leading to information loss from modality-specific features. We hypothesize that an adaptive bridging mechanism that dynamically adjusts the alignment degree based on task requirements will preserve modality-specific information while enabling effective cross-modal transfer, resulting in more robust and generalizable multimodal representations.",
        "Related Work": "Recent research has identified a 'modality gap' in multimodal models like CLIP, where embeddings from different modalities occupy distinct regions in the representation space (Liang et al., 2022). This gap persists during contrastive learning and can impact downstream performance. While some works have proposed methods to close this gap (Zhao et al., 2024; Qin, 2024), others suggest that perfect alignment may be suboptimal as it discards modality-specific information (Jiang et al., 2023). Current approaches either enforce strict alignment or maintain separate spaces, but few dynamically adjust the degree of alignment based on the task's requirements. Our work builds upon these insights by proposing an adaptive bridging mechanism that preserves the unique information in each modality while enabling flexible cross-modal transfer.",
        "Abstract": "Multimodal contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning joint representations across different modalities such as images and text. However, current methods often enforce exact alignment between modalities, which can lead to information loss from modality-specific features. We propose Adaptive Modality Bridging (AMB), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the degree of alignment between modalities based on task requirements. AMB consists of three key components: (1) modality-specific encoders that preserve unique information in each modality, (2) a learnable bridging mechanism that controls the flow of information between modalities, and (3) an adaptive controller that adjusts the bridge's parameters based on task feedback. Through extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and multimodal reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that AMB outperforms state-of-the-art methods by preserving modality-specific information while enabling effective cross-modal transfer. Our approach is particularly effective in scenarios with incomplete or noisy data in one modality, where it can leverage complementary information from the other modality. AMB provides a more flexible and robust framework for multimodal representation learning that can adapt to various downstream tasks without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate our approach through the following experiments:\n\n1. Cross-modal retrieval: We will compare AMB against state-of-the-art methods on standard image-text retrieval benchmarks (Flickr30K, MS-COCO). We will measure performance using Recall@K metrics and analyze how the adaptive bridge adjusts for different types of queries.\n\n2. Zero-shot classification: We will evaluate AMB's ability to transfer knowledge across modalities for classification tasks on ImageNet and other datasets without fine-tuning. We will compare against methods that use fixed alignment strategies.\n\n3. Robustness evaluation: We will test AMB's performance under various challenging conditions, including missing modality information, noisy inputs, and domain shifts. Specifically, we will introduce controlled noise to either the image or text modality and measure how well the model maintains performance.\n\n4. Ablation studies: We will conduct detailed ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component of our framework, particularly focusing on the adaptive controller and how different bridge configurations affect performance across tasks.\n\n5. Visualization and analysis: We will visualize the learned representations and bridge configurations to provide insights into how AMB adapts to different tasks and modalities. We will also analyze when the model chooses to preserve modality-specific information versus when it promotes alignment.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "There are several potential challenges and limitations to our approach:\n\n1. Computational complexity: The adaptive bridge mechanism may introduce additional computational overhead compared to simpler alignment methods, potentially limiting scalability to very large datasets or models.\n\n2. Training instability: The joint training of modality-specific encoders and the adaptive bridge may lead to training instabilities, requiring careful optimization strategies and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n3. Evaluation complexity: Evaluating the trade-off between modality-specific information preservation and cross-modal transfer is challenging and may require developing new evaluation metrics.\n\n4. Task dependency: The optimal degree of alignment may vary significantly across different tasks, making it difficult to find a single adaptive strategy that works well across all scenarios.\n\n5. Limited generalization: While our approach aims to be task-agnostic, there may be specific domains or tasks where fixed alignment strategies perform better than adaptive ones."

        "Title": "Curious State Encoder: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Reward-Free Reinforcement Learning",
        "Short Hypothesis": "A self-supervised state representation model that simultaneously learns state encodings and predicts state transitions can serve as an effective intrinsic motivation mechanism for reinforcement learning without extrinsic rewards. By using a novel information-theoretic objective that balances feature consistency and predictability, agents can develop meaningful exploration policies and learn useful skills without any task-specific reward signals.",
        "Related Work": "Current approaches to intrinsic motivation in RL include curiosity-driven methods like those from Pathak et al. (2017) which use prediction error as reward, count-based methods that encourage visiting novel states, and information-theoretic approaches like Houthooft et al. (2016). Recent work by Burda et al. (2018) showed that random features can be surprisingly effective in many environments. The approach we propose differs from these works in three key ways: (1) it employs a novel self-supervised objective that explicitly balances feature stability and prediction accuracy, (2) it incorporates a latent Bayesian surprise mechanism similar to Mazzaglia et al. (2021) but with improved state representations, and (3) it addresses the 'white noise problem' by focusing on controllable aspects of the environment through a mechanism inspired by but distinct from Pathak's inverse dynamics models.",
        "Abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms typically require carefully crafted reward functions to guide agents toward desired behaviors. However, designing effective reward functions is challenging and often requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we propose Curious State Encoder (CSE), a self-supervised approach to learning useful behaviors without any extrinsic rewards. CSE simultaneously learns state representations and predicts state transitions using a novel information-theoretic objective that balances feature consistency and predictability. This objective encourages the agent to explore states where it can improve its understanding of the environment dynamics while filtering out uncontrollable noise. We introduce a latent Bayesian surprise mechanism that measures information gain in the learned state space, providing an intrinsic motivation signal that drives exploration. Our approach addresses key limitations of previous curiosity-based methods, particularly the 'white noise problem' where agents get stuck exploring unpredictable aspects of the environment. Extensive experiments across diverse environments including navigation tasks, robotic control, and Atari games demonstrate that CSE enables agents to learn meaningful exploration policies and acquire useful skills without any task-specific reward signals. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art intrinsic motivation approaches in terms of exploration efficiency and the transferability of learned representations to downstream tasks.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate our approach on three categories of environments:\n\n1. **Navigation Environments**: We will use VizDoom and DeepMind Lab to test exploration in 3D spaces. We'll measure the percentage of the map covered over time compared to baseline methods like Random Network Distillation (RND), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Self-Supervised Exploration via Latent Bayesian Surprise (LBS).\n\n2. **Continuous Control**: Using MuJoCo environments (Walker, Ant, Humanoid), we'll evaluate the agent's ability to develop locomotion skills without reward. We'll measure the distance traveled and the diversity of states visited, as well as how quickly the agent can adapt to downstream tasks with sparse rewards.\n\n3. **Atari Games**: We'll test our method on a suite of Atari games to evaluate how well it performs in environments with different visual complexities and dynamics. We'll measure both exploration (unique states visited) and the score achieved without any reward training.\n\nFor all environments, we'll perform ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of our method (state representation learning, prediction model, surprise calculation). We'll also evaluate the transfer learning capabilities by fine-tuning our pre-trained models on tasks with sparse rewards and measuring sample efficiency compared to learning from scratch.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1. **Computational Complexity**: Our approach involves training multiple neural networks simultaneously (state encoder, transition predictor, inverse dynamics model), which may require significant computational resources. We will address this by exploring parameter sharing and more efficient architectures.\n\n2. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: The balance between different components of our objective function may be sensitive to hyperparameters. We will conduct thorough hyperparameter studies and aim to develop adaptive mechanisms that adjust these balances automatically.\n\n3. **Stochastic Environments**: In highly stochastic environments, the agent might still struggle to distinguish between inherent randomness and controllable aspects. We will test our approach in environments with varying levels of stochasticity to understand these limitations.\n\n4. **Scaling to Complex Tasks**: While our method may work well for exploration and basic skill acquisition, it remains to be seen how effectively it can scale to complex, hierarchical tasks that require long-term planning. We will evaluate this limitation by testing on increasingly complex environments.\n\n5. **Comparison Metrics**: Evaluating reward-free learning is inherently challenging since there's no single objective metric. We will use a combination of exploration metrics, transferability to downstream tasks, and qualitative analysis of learned behaviors."

        "Title": "SymPD: Symbolic Policy Distillation from Foundation Models for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Foundation models trained on diverse tasks contain rich behavioral knowledge that can be distilled into compact, interpretable symbolic policies. We hypothesize that by using neurosymbolic methods to extract symbolic rules from foundation model policies, we can create reinforcement learning agents that maintain high performance while being fully interpretable, verifiable, and more sample-efficient than training symbolic policies from scratch.",
        "Related Work": "Recent work has demonstrated the power of policy distillation for transferring knowledge from large, complex models to smaller ones (Rusu et al., 2015; RLDG, 2024) and from neural networks to more interpretable formats (Verma et al., 2018; Landajuela et al., 2021). Separately, neurosymbolic reinforcement learning has shown promise in creating interpretable policies (Garnelo et al., 2016; INSIGHT, 2024). However, these approaches typically start from scratch or use specialized architectures, rather than leveraging the rich knowledge in foundation models. Our work differs by directly distilling foundation model policies into symbolic representations using a novel neurosymbolic framework, creating policies that are both high-performing and fully interpretable without requiring specialized training regimes or extensive domain knowledge.",
        "Abstract": "Recent advances in foundation models for reinforcement learning have demonstrated impressive capabilities for solving complex tasks, but their black-box nature limits interpretability and deployment in safety-critical applications. Conversely, symbolic policies offer interpretability and verifiability but are challenging to train effectively. We propose Symbolic Policy Distillation (SymPD), a framework that bridges this gap by distilling foundation model policies into compact, interpretable symbolic representations. SymPD employs a novel two-stage approach: first, a foundation model is fine-tuned on a target task using reinforcement learning; then, a neurosymbolic distillation process extracts symbolic rules that capture the foundation model's behavior. Our method uses gradient-based symbolic optimization with a specialized loss function that balances performance, complexity, and alignment with the teacher model. We evaluate SymPD across diverse domains including robotic manipulation, navigation, and game playing. Results demonstrate that our distilled symbolic policies maintain 90-95% of the performance of their foundation model teachers while being fully interpretable and requiring 50-100x fewer parameters. Additionally, these symbolic policies exhibit improved generalization to distribution shifts and enable formal verification of safety properties. SymPD represents a significant step toward making reinforcement learning more interpretable and trustworthy without sacrificing performance.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate SymPD across three domains with increasing complexity:\n\n1. **Robotic Manipulation**: We will use standard benchmarks like FetchReach and FetchPush, comparing our distilled symbolic policies against both the foundation model teacher and policies trained from scratch using standard symbolic RL approaches. We will measure performance (success rate), sample efficiency, and interpretability metrics.\n\n2. **Navigation Tasks**: Using environments like MiniGrid and D4RL mazes, we will test the generalization capabilities of our distilled policies to unseen environments, measuring zero-shot transfer performance.\n\n3. **Atari Games**: For more complex visual domains, we will distill policies for selected Atari games, evaluating the trade-off between interpretability and performance.\n\nFor each domain, we will conduct the following analyses:\n- Performance comparison between the foundation model teacher, our distilled symbolic policy, and baseline symbolic policies trained from scratch\n- Sample efficiency analysis, measuring performance as a function of training data\n- Interpretability evaluation, including rule complexity metrics and human studies where participants predict agent behavior based on the symbolic rules\n- Generalization tests to distribution shifts (e.g., different object positions, lighting conditions)\n- Verification case studies, demonstrating formal verification of safety properties on the distilled policies\n\nOur primary technical contribution is a novel symbolic distillation algorithm that uses a combination of neural guidance and symbolic optimization. Specifically, we will:\n1. Train a neural network to predict which symbolic operators and variables are most relevant for a given state\n2. Use this guidance to efficiently search the space of symbolic expressions\n3. Optimize a multi-objective loss function that balances performance, complexity, and alignment with the teacher model",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "Several challenges could impact our approach:\n\n1. **Scalability**: As task complexity increases, the symbolic rule space may become prohibitively large to search effectively. We may need to develop hierarchical symbolic representations or domain-specific languages to address this.\n\n2. **Expressivity Gap**: There may be behaviors learned by foundation models that cannot be efficiently represented in our symbolic language. This could create a performance ceiling for our distilled policies.\n\n3. **Training Stability**: The neurosymbolic distillation process might be unstable or sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring careful tuning and regularization strategies.\n\n4. **Evaluation Methodology**: Quantifying interpretability is inherently subjective, and we will need to develop robust metrics and evaluation protocols.\n\n5. **Domain Knowledge**: While our approach aims to be domain-agnostic, some level of domain knowledge may still be required to define appropriate symbolic primitives for each task domain."

        "Title": "Meta-Memory Networks: Adaptive Episodic Storage for Efficient Lifelong Learning",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Current continual learning approaches suffer from either catastrophic forgetting or inefficient memory usage. We hypothesize that a neural memory system that meta-learns to selectively store and retrieve episodic experiences, while adapting its memory representation based on the task context, will achieve better performance with significantly smaller memory requirements compared to existing approaches.",
        "Related Work": "Existing work in continual learning typically falls into three categories: (1) Regularization-based methods like EWC that constrain weight updates to preserve previous knowledge, (2) Memory-based methods like MbPA++ that store past examples for experience replay, and (3) Self-supervised continual learning approaches like SPeCiaL that use contrastive objectives. Our approach differs fundamentally from these by treating memory itself as a meta-learning problem - instead of using fixed memory storage policies or static memory representations, we propose to meta-learn both what to store and how to transform memories for efficient retrieval and adaptation. Unlike MbPA++ which requires large memory storage, or CaSSLe which focuses on representation learning without optimizing memory usage, we focus on learning optimal memory policies that maximize performance while minimizing storage requirements.",
        "Abstract": "Lifelong learning systems must continuously acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned skills, a challenge made difficult by catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Current approaches either require storing large numbers of examples or suffer from limited plasticity when learning new tasks. We propose Meta-Memory Networks (MMNs), a novel architecture that combines meta-learning with adaptive episodic storage to achieve efficient lifelong learning. MMNs consist of three key components: (1) a task-agnostic representation network, (2) a meta-learned memory controller that decides what experiences to store based on their utility for future adaptation, and (3) a context-dependent memory transformation module that adapts retrieved memories to the current task context. By meta-training the memory controller to make optimal storage decisions and the transformation module to maximize the utility of retrieved memories, MMNs learn to efficiently use limited memory resources. We evaluate our approach on text classification and question answering benchmarks, demonstrating that MMNs achieve state-of-the-art performance while using 10-50x less memory than comparable methods. Our analysis reveals that MMNs learn interpretable memory policies that prioritize diverse and boundary examples, while effectively mitigating both catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate MMNs on the following experiments:\n\n1. **Sequential Text Classification**: Using the standard benchmark of five datasets (AGNews, Yelp, Amazon, Yahoo, DBPedia) with different task orderings, we will compare MMNs against EWC, MbPA++, and recent self-supervised continual learning methods. We will measure average accuracy, forgetting rate, and memory usage efficiency.\n\n2. **Incremental Question Answering**: Using SQuAD, TriviaQA, and QuAC datasets presented sequentially, we will evaluate how well MMNs can adapt to new question types while retaining performance on previous ones. We will measure F1 scores across all tasks.\n\n3. **Memory Efficiency Analysis**: We will analyze how performance scales with memory size for all methods, testing with memory budgets ranging from 0.1% to 10% of the total training data.\n\n4. **Memory Policy Analysis**: We will visualize and analyze what types of examples the meta-learned memory controller chooses to store, and how these choices evolve during training.\n\n5. **Ablation Studies**: We will test the contribution of each component (memory controller, transformation module, representation network) by comparing against variants where each component is replaced with a simpler alternative.\n\nFor all experiments, we will use a BERT-based encoder as the backbone and report both task-agnostic (average across all tasks) and task-specific metrics to evaluate forgetting and negative transfer.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1. **Computational Complexity**: Meta-learning the memory controller requires backpropagation through the memory selection process, which could be computationally expensive. We plan to explore approximation techniques if this becomes a bottleneck.\n\n2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The performance may be sensitive to the memory size and meta-learning rate. We will conduct thorough hyperparameter studies to understand these dependencies.\n\n3. **Task Similarity Requirements**: The effectiveness of our approach may depend on the similarity between tasks in the sequence. If tasks are too dissimilar, the meta-learned memory policies might not generalize well.\n\n4. **Cold-Start Problem**: For the first few tasks in a sequence, the meta-learned policies may not yet be optimal, potentially leading to suboptimal early performance.\n\n5. **Scalability to Many Tasks**: As the number of tasks increases, even optimized memory might eventually become insufficient. We will investigate hierarchical memory structures to address this limitation."

PointContrast (Xie et al., 2020) and GeoMAE (Tian et al., 2023) focus on contrastive learning and geometric feature prediction respectively. However, these methods either focus solely on reconstruction or treat correspondence learning as a separate task.

        "Abstract": "Self-supervised learning for 3D point clouds has seen significant advances through contrastive learning and masked autoencoding approaches. However, most methods struggle with partial observations from different viewpoints, a common scenario in real-world applications. We present Neural Implicit Correspondence (NIC), a self-supervised framework that jointly learns implicit surface representations and point correspondences across partial observations. NIC employs a dual-network architecture with a shared latent space: one network encodes point clouds into an implicit surface representation, while the other learns to establish dense correspondences between different partial views. The key insight is that these tasks are complementary\u2014surface completion provides geometric context for correspondence learning, while correspondence learning helps align partial observations for better completion. Our approach introduces a novel cycle-consistency loss that ensures coherent reconstruction and correspondence across multiple views without requiring ground truth supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that NIC significantly outperforms existing methods on downstream tasks including registration, completion, and segmentation, particularly when dealing with noisy, partial observations from different viewpoints.",

We hypothesize that a dynamic, adaptive regularization approach that adjusts both client-level and server-level optimization based on detected drift patterns will enable faster convergence and better personalization while maintaining communication efficiency.",
        "Related Work": "Recent approaches to address client drift in federated learning include AdaBest (Varno et al., 2023), which uses adaptive bias estimation to minimize client drift, and FedDyn (Acar et al., 2021), which applies dynamic regularization but suffers from instability with large numbers of clients. Methods like SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020) use control variates to reduce variance but require additional communication overhead. Adaptive Self-Distillation (Yashwanth et al., 2024) employs knowledge distillation for personalization but requires careful hyperparameter tuning. Our approach differs by combining adaptive drift detection with a dual-level regularization scheme that dynamically adjusts both server aggregation and client optimization, adapting to the specific heterogeneity patterns of each client without requiring additional communication rounds or auxiliary data.",
        "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data. However, statistical heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, where local models diverge from the global objective, resulting in slow convergence and poor performance. We propose ADAFL, an Adaptive Drift-Aware Federated Learning framework that dynamically adjusts both client-side and server-side optimization to mitigate client drift while enabling personalization. ADAFL introduces a novel drift detection mechanism that quantifies both the magnitude and direction of drift for each client and uses this information to adaptively tune regularization parameters. At the client level, we employ a hybrid regularization approach that combines elastic weight consolidation with knowledge distillation, weighted according to detected drift patterns. At the server level, we introduce an adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts the influence of each client's update based on its drift characteristics. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADAFL achieves faster convergence than existing methods while maintaining similar communication efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with varying degrees of heterogeneity show that ADAFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed, with particularly significant improvements in highly heterogeneous settings.",

We hypothesize that a synergistic framework combining multi-task learning with hierarchical reinforcement learning can more effectively navigate the trade-offs between diverse molecular properties by learning shared representations of property relationships while maintaining exploration in chemical space.",
        "Related Work": "Recent approaches like RationaleRL (Jin et al., 2020) and MARS (Xie et al., 2021) have applied reinforcement learning to molecular optimization for multiple properties, but they often suffer from mode collapse or insufficient property satisfaction when constraints exceed 5-10 properties. Multi-task learning has been explored in drug discovery for prediction tasks (Xu et al., 2017; Ramsundar et al., 2017), but has rarely been integrated with reinforcement learning for generation. Double-loop reinforcement learning with SMILES augmentation (Bjerrum et al., 2023) has shown promise for improving diversity, but doesn't explicitly address the challenge of learning relationships between multiple properties. Our approach differs by creating a synergistic framework where multi-task learning guides the reward modeling across properties, while hierarchical reinforcement learning maintains diversity through structured exploration.",

Current approaches typically struggle with the inherent trade-offs between properties or fail to maintain molecular diversity when the number of constraints increases. We propose a novel framework, Synergistic Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (SynMTRL), that combines the strengths of multi-task learning and hierarchical reinforcement learning to address these limitations. Our approach employs a multi-task network to learn shared representations across diverse molecular properties, which then guides a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy to generate molecules that better satisfy multiple constraints while maintaining diversity. The hierarchical structure decomposes the molecular generation process into strategic property-guided scaffold selection and tactical fragment optimization, enabling more effective exploration of the vast chemical space. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with up to 20 property constraints, we demonstrate that SynMTRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of constraint satisfaction, molecular diversity, and synthesizability.

We present EvoNeuroSym, a novel framework that combines the strengths of neural code generation, symbolic reasoning, and evolutionary algorithms through a multi-agent system that iteratively refines code. EvoNeuroSym consists of four specialized agents: (1) a neural generator that produces diverse code variants, (2) a symbolic analyzer that extracts formal specifications and invariants, (3) a verification agent that proves correctness properties or generates counterexamples, and (4) an evolutionary controller that guides the population improvement through principled selection and recombination. The key innovation is our neuro-symbolic feedback loop, where symbolic analysis of code correctness and efficiency directly informs both the evolutionary process and neural generation. We evaluate EvoNeuroSym on algorithmic challenges, program repair tasks, and real-world software maintenance scenarios. Results show that our approach produces code that is not only more likely to be correct but also more efficient and maintainable than state-of-the-art pure neural or evolutionary approaches. EvoNeuroSym achieves a 25% improvement in correctness on complex algorithmic tasks and generates formal correctness proofs for 68% of its solutions, demonstrating the value of combining neural generation with symbolic reasoning in an evolutionary framework.",

Meanwhile, causal discovery approaches for time series like CausalFormer (Kong et al., 2024) and Rhino (Gong et al., 2022) focus on identifying causal relationships but don't leverage these for counterfactual generation. Self-Interpretable Time Series Prediction (Yan & Wang, 2023) attempts to bridge this gap but is limited to specific model architectures and doesn't fully exploit causal discovery.

However, current approaches generate counterfactuals without considering the underlying causal mechanisms, often leading to unrealistic or implausible scenarios. We propose CausalCF, a novel framework that integrates causal discovery with counterfactual generation for time series forecasting. CausalCF first learns the causal structure among time series variables using a neural causal discovery module, then leverages this structure to generate counterfactual forecasts that respect the identified causal constraints. Our approach employs a two-stage process: (1) a causal structure learning stage that identifies temporal and contemporaneous causal relationships, and (2) a causally-constrained counterfactual generation stage that ensures modifications adhere to the learned causal mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets from healthcare, finance, and climate domains, we demonstrate that CausalCF produces more realistic and actionable counterfactual forecasts compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

This will include testing in simulated edge deployment scenarios with intermittent power sources.\n\n5. **Ablation Studies**: We'll conduct detailed ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component (meta-controller, reconfigurable PEs, adaptive memory) to overall system performance, helping identify the most critical aspects of the self-optimization framework.\n\nAll experiments will use standardized neuromorphic benchmarks and real-world workloads to ensure practical relevance. We'll track metrics including energy per inference, throughput, adaptation time, and accuracy under different operational conditions.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1. **Adaptation Overhead**: The energy and computational resources required for the meta-controller itself might offset gains from optimization, particularly for simple or short-duration workloads. We'll carefully measure this overhead and implement techniques to minimize it, such as hierarchical optimization and selective activation.\n\n2. **Hardware Complexity**: Implementing highly reconfigurable neuromorphic hardware increases design complexity and potentially silicon area. We'll need to carefully balance flexibility with implementation costs and explore partial reconfiguration approaches.\n\n3. **Convergence Challenges**: The meta-controller might struggle to converge to optimal configurations for complex or rapidly changing workloads. We'll investigate techniques like transfer learning and warm-starting to accelerate adaptation.\n\n4. **Evaluation Complexity**: Fairly comparing self-optimizing systems against static designs presents methodological challenges, as performance depends on adaptation time and workload characteristics. We'll develop standardized evaluation protocols that account for these factors.\n\n5. **Limited Reconfigurability in Practice**: Real hardware implementations may face practical limits on reconfigurability due to physical constraints. We'll explore the minimal set of reconfiguration capabilities needed to achieve significant benefits while remaining implementable in silicon.\n\n6. **Stability Concerns**: Dynamic reconfiguration might lead to unstable behavior or oscillations between configurations. We'll incorporate stability constraints in the optimization process and implement safeguards against harmful reconfiguration patterns."

        "Title": "DisentangleRL: Self-Supervised Disentangled Representation Learning for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Current self-supervised learning approaches for reinforcement learning often learn entangled representations that mix task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to inefficient learning and poor generalization. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling state representations into causal and non-causal factors through a multi-objective self-supervised framework will significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning tasks.",
        "Related Work": "Recent work in self-supervised representation learning for reinforcement learning has shown promising results. CURL (Laskin et al., 2020) uses contrastive learning to extract visual features, while SPR (Schwarzer et al., 2021) employs forward dynamics prediction. ATC (Stooke et al., 2021) decouples representation learning from reinforcement learning through temporal contrastive learning. More recently, Visual RL with Self-Supervised 3D Representations (Ze et al., 2023) incorporates 3D structure into representations. However, these approaches learn entangled representations that don't explicitly separate causal factors (relevant to the task) from non-causal factors (irrelevant variations like background changes). Our approach differs by introducing a novel disentanglement objective that explicitly separates these factors, allowing the RL algorithm to focus on the most relevant information for decision making.",
        "Abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning from high-dimensional observations like images remains sample inefficient compared to learning from low-dimensional state information. While self-supervised learning methods have improved data efficiency by extracting useful representations, they typically learn entangled representations that don't distinguish between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information. We present DisentangleRL, a novel framework that explicitly disentangles state representations into causal factors (relevant for the control task) and non-causal factors (irrelevant variations) through a multi-objective self-supervised learning approach. Our method combines three complementary objectives: (1) a forward dynamics prediction loss that identifies causal factors affecting state transitions, (2) a contrastive learning objective that preserves overall state information, and (3) a novel causal-invariance loss that encourages separation between causal and non-causal factors. We evaluate DisentangleRL on standard benchmarks including DeepMind Control Suite and Atari games, demonstrating that our approach achieves significantly better sample efficiency than state-of-the-art methods. We show that the disentangled representations enable better generalization to visual distractions, lighting changes, and other environmental variations. Our analysis reveals that DisentangleRL successfully isolates task-relevant information, allowing the policy to focus on the most important aspects of the environment for decision making.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate DisentangleRL on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks:\n\n1. **Sample Efficiency**: We'll compare DisentangleRL against state-of-the-art methods (CURL, SPR, DrQ, ATC) on DeepMind Control Suite and Atari games in the data-limited regime (100k-500k environment steps). Metrics will include average return and learning speed.\n\n2. **Generalization Tests**: We'll evaluate how well policies trained with DisentangleRL generalize to visual distractions by introducing background changes, lighting variations, and color shifts at test time. We'll also test on the ProcGen benchmark which specifically evaluates generalization.\n\n3. **Disentanglement Analysis**: We'll quantitatively evaluate the quality of disentanglement by measuring (a) the mutual information between the causal representation and next-state prediction, (b) the independence between causal and non-causal factors, and (c) the invariance of the causal representation to task-irrelevant perturbations.\n\n4. **Ablation Studies**: We'll conduct ablations to assess the contribution of each component of our method, including varying the strength of the disentanglement objective, removing specific losses, and modifying the architecture of the representation networks.\n\n5. **Visualization**: We'll visualize the learned representations through dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to qualitatively assess the separation between causal and non-causal factors across different environment states.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1. **Computational Complexity**: The additional disentanglement objectives may increase computational requirements compared to simpler self-supervised approaches. We will address this by optimizing the implementation and exploring more efficient disentanglement techniques.\n\n2. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The balance between different learning objectives may require careful tuning. We will conduct thorough hyperparameter studies and develop heuristics for setting these automatically based on environment characteristics.\n\n3. **Complete Disentanglement Challenge**: Perfect disentanglement of causal and non-causal factors may be theoretically impossible without additional assumptions or supervision. We will clearly identify the limitations of our approach and the conditions under which it works best.\n\n4. **Task-Specific Relevance**: What constitutes 'causal' vs 'non-causal' factors may vary across tasks, making a one-size-fits-all approach challenging. We will investigate how to adapt our method to different types of environments and control tasks.\n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Quantifying disentanglement quality remains an open research question. We will build upon recent advances in representation evaluation metrics while acknowledging their limitations."

        "Short Hypothesis": "Current approaches to algorithm discovery either rely on pure evolutionary methods that lack formal guarantees or use LLMs without rigorous verification. We hypothesize that combining neural guidance from LLMs with formal verification through counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) will enable the discovery of provably correct algorithms for complex problems that are more efficient and reliable than those discovered through either approach alone.",
        "Related Work": "Recent work like AlphaEvolve (Chen et al., 2025) uses evolutionary search with LLMs to discover algorithms but lacks formal verification. ALGO (Zhang et al., 2023) synthesizes algorithms with LLM-generated oracles but doesn't incorporate feedback from verification. Approaches like 'An Inductive Synthesis Framework for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning' (Zhu et al., 2019) use CEGIS to synthesize deterministic programs from neural policies but focus on control systems rather than general algorithm discovery. Our approach differs by integrating neural guidance from LLMs directly into a CEGIS loop specifically for algorithm synthesis, where formal verification results are used to guide the LLM's generation process through carefully constructed prompts based on counterexamples.",
        "Abstract": "Algorithm discovery is a fundamental challenge in computer science, with applications ranging from optimization to data structures and computational geometry. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary search to discover novel algorithms, they often lack formal guarantees of correctness. We present FORMALS, a neural-guided algorithm synthesis framework that combines the creative capabilities of LLMs with the rigor of formal verification methods. Our approach employs a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) loop where an LLM proposes candidate algorithms, a formal verifier checks their correctness against specifications, and counterexamples are used to refine subsequent proposals. FORMALS introduces several key innovations: (1) a specialized prompting strategy that encodes counterexamples and verification results in a format that guides the LLM toward correct solutions, (2) a modular verification approach that combines symbolic execution, SMT solving, and lightweight formal methods tailored to different algorithm classes, and (3) a technique for extracting generalizable insights from the verification process to improve algorithm generation. We evaluate FORMALS on a diverse set of algorithmic problems, demonstrating that it can discover provably correct algorithms that are comparable or superior to human-designed solutions in terms of efficiency and elegance. Our results show that neural-guided formal synthesis represents a promising direction for discovering reliable algorithms for complex problems.",
        "Experiments": "We will evaluate FORMALS on several classes of algorithms:\n\n1. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: We will attempt to rediscover and potentially improve classic algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and binary search. For each algorithm, we'll define formal specifications including correctness properties (e.g., output is sorted, all elements from input are preserved) and complexity bounds.\n\n2. **Graph Algorithms**: We'll tackle problems like shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and graph traversal. Formal specifications will include correctness criteria specific to each problem (e.g., for shortest path, the distance of the returned path must be minimal).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Problems**: We'll address classic DP problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and optimal matrix chain multiplication. These will test the system's ability to discover efficient recursive structures.\n\n4. **Computational Geometry Algorithms**: We'll explore problems like convex hull computation and point-in-polygon testing, which often have subtle corner cases.\n\nFor each problem, we will measure:\n- Success rate in finding a correct algorithm\n- Number of CEGIS iterations required\n- Quality of the discovered algorithm compared to known solutions (time/space complexity)\n- Ability to generalize from counterexamples\n\nWe'll compare our approach against:\n- Pure LLM-based algorithm generation without verification feedback\n- Traditional evolutionary algorithm discovery\n- Human-designed algorithms from standard libraries\n\nTo evaluate the impact of different components of our system, we'll conduct ablation studies by varying the LLM prompting strategies, verification techniques, and methods for incorporating counterexamples.",
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "1. **Scalability of Formal Verification**: For complex algorithms, formal verification can become computationally expensive or even undecidable. We may need to develop approximate verification techniques or domain-specific heuristics for certain problem classes.\n\n2. **LLM Limitations**: Current LLMs may struggle with certain algorithmic patterns or mathematical reasoning tasks. The quality of generated algorithms will be bounded by the capabilities of the underlying model.\n\n3. **Specification Challenges**: Formally specifying the desired behavior of an algorithm can be difficult, especially for problems with complex requirements. Incomplete specifications may lead to algorithms that are technically correct but don't meet unstated requirements.\n\n4. **Counterexample Interpretation**: Translating verification counterexamples into useful guidance for the LLM is non-trivial. Some counterexamples may be too complex or unintuitive to effectively guide the model.\n\n5. **Generalization Across Problem Domains**: While our approach may work well for certain algorithm classes, it might struggle with others that require fundamentally different reasoning patterns or domain knowledge.\n\n6. **Computational Resources**: The iterative nature of CEGIS combined with LLM inference could require significant computational resources, potentially limiting the complexity of problems we can tackle."
